# Heron Metrics Validation System

## Overview
The validation system is responsible for ensuring the quality and reliability of company metrics used in the Heron scoring system. It performs comprehensive validation checks on various types of metrics, including financial, operational, and data quality metrics.

## Components

### 1. Main Validation Script
- `validate_metrics.py`: Core script that orchestrates the validation process
  - Loads and processes metrics data
  - Applies validation rules
  - Generates validation reports
  - Handles data quality checks

### 2. Validation Results
- `validation_results/`: Directory containing validation outputs
  - Validated metrics
  - Validation reports
  - Quality assessment results
  - Error logs

### 3. Validators
- `validators/`: Directory containing specialized validation modules
  - Financial metric validators
  - Operational metric validators
  - Data quality validators
  - Custom validation rules

## Validation Types

### Financial Metrics
- Revenue validation
- Balance validation
- Cash flow validation
- Tax payment validation
- Debt and investment validation

### Operational Metrics
- Transaction validation
- Customer interaction validation
- Account activity validation
- Risk indicator validation

### Data Quality Metrics
- Confidence score validation
- Coverage validation
- Data freshness validation
- Completeness checks
- Consistency validation

## Usage

### Running Validation
```python
# Run the validation script
python validate_metrics.py --input path/to/metrics.csv --output validation_results/
```

### Validation Process
1. Data Loading
   - Load metrics from input file
   - Preprocess data
   - Handle missing values

2. Validation Rules
   - Apply financial validation rules
   - Apply operational validation rules
   - Apply data quality rules
   - Check for anomalies

3. Results Generation
   - Generate validation reports
   - Save validated metrics
   - Create quality assessment

## Output

### Validation Results
- `company_metrics_validated.csv`: Cleaned and validated metrics
- `validation_report.csv`: Detailed validation results
- `quality_assessment.txt`: Overall data quality assessment
- `error_log.txt`: Log of validation errors and warnings

### Report Contents
- Validation status for each metric
- Data quality scores
- Anomaly detection results
- Missing value analysis
- Consistency checks

## Dependencies
- pandas
- numpy
- logging
- json
- os

## Validation Rules

### Financial Rules
- Revenue must be non-negative
- Balance must be within expected ranges
- Cash flow must be consistent
- Tax payments must be validated
- Debt metrics must be logical

### Operational Rules
- Transaction counts must be non-negative
- Customer metrics must be consistent
- Activity patterns must be valid
- Risk scores must be in valid ranges

### Data Quality Rules
- Confidence scores must be between 0 and 1
- Coverage must be within expected ranges
- Data must be sufficiently fresh
- Required fields must be present
- Values must be consistent

## Notes
- The validation system is crucial for ensuring data quality
- All metrics must pass validation before being used in scoring
- Validation rules are regularly updated based on new requirements
- The system includes both automated and manual validation checks
- Results are used to improve data quality and system reliability
